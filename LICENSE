# Licensing

This repository contains primarily prose / conceptual / ontological content (documentation, white papers, conceptual specifications) with the possibility of future code artifacts. To maximize constructive reuse while requiring attribution for scholarly / academic contexts, a dual license strategy is used:

- Documentation, ontology descriptions, white papers, and other prose: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
- Any source code (if/when added): MIT License

If you contribute, you agree your contribution is provided under the same dual terms (prose under CC BY 4.0, code under MIT) unless explicitly stated otherwise in the contribution.
