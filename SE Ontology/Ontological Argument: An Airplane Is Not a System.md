### Ontological Argument: An Airplane Is Not a System

Using Barry Smith's Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as the foundation, an airplane is classified as an **artifact** and **object**—a material entity with causal unity achieved through engineered assembly (CU3 in Smith's terminology). It is not a system, which ontology defines more narrowly as a connected group of interdependent elements unified for a specific function, often as a subsystem within a larger entity. Systems require mutual dependence (MSD) among parts for their identity and function, creating a non-summative whole. Airplanes, like cars or washing machines, are maximal objects that host or employ systems (e.g., propulsion, hydraulic) but lack the defining interdependence across all parts to qualify as systems themselves. This avoids misuse in systems engineering, where "system" is often loosely applied to any complex artifact, leading to conceptual confusion (as Smith notes in his "Ontology for Systems Engineering" lectures, where he clarifies terms to prevent failures like the Airbus wiring mismatch).

Smith's work emphasizes realist ontology: We identify entities via observable structures, dependencies, and boundaries, not subjective or engineering convenience. For example, in his Material Entities paper, cars are objects due to "causal unity via mechanical assemblies joined through screws or other fasteners," but in his systems engineering talks, he exemplifies systems as bounded functionals like a car's hydraulic setup—not the car itself.

### Addressing Counterarguments from Systems Engineers

Systems engineers might argue aggressively using INCOSE-like views (e.g., "a system is an integrated set of elements that accomplish a defined objective"), but we'll counter ontologically, avoiding those definitions.

- **Counter to "If I remove the engines, it can't fly, so it's a system"**:  
  Removing engines disrupts the propulsion subsystem (a true system with MSD among parts like turbines and fuel lines, unified for thrust). The airplane remains an intact object/artifact, identifiable as such (e.g., it still has wings, fuselage). Ontology distinguishes: Objects can lose parts without losing identity if they retain causal unity (per BFO, objects are "maximally self-connected"). A heap of airplane parts post-disassembly is an object aggregate (loose collection lacking unity), but the assembled airplane is an object hosting systems. Analogy: Removing a person's heart stops life, but the person is a substance, not a system—the circulatory system is the dependent whole that fails.

- **Counter to "Flight is emergent, so the aircraft is a system"**:  
  Emergence (unpredictable properties from part interactions) occurs in many entities, but doesn't make something a system ontologically. Flight emerges from coordinated subsystems (e.g., aerodynamic, control, propulsion), each with MSD and bounded function. The airplane as a whole is the artifact enabling this integration, but its parts lack universal MSD—e.g., a seat doesn't depend on the wing for existence, unlike glands in an endocrine system. In BFO, emergence aligns with occurrents (processes like flying), not the continuant object (airplane). Smith clarifies in his lectures: Random connections don't make a system; purposeful interdependence does. Misuse here treats the host artifact as the system, ignoring ontological granularity (e.g., subsystems vs. whole).

These counters rely on epistemology: Identify via dependence analysis and mesoscopic observation (everyday-scale testing of unity), not functional outcomes alone.

### Checklist to Determine If Something Is a System

Use this step-by-step checklist during discussions. It's based on Smith's BFO criteria: unity via dependence, mereology (parts/wholes), and topology (boundaries). For each item, ask for evidence; if most fail, it's likely an object, aggregate, or artifact—not a system.

1. **Interdependence of Parts (MSD Test)**: Do key parts exhibit mutual specific dependence (MSD(x,y): x needs y and y needs x to exist/function)? Example: In a hydraulic system, fluid MSD pipes. If parts can exist independently (e.g., airplane wing without engine), score as non-system.

2. **Unity Beyond Summation**: Is the whole non-summative (more than part sum due to relations)? Test: Can it change parts while retaining identity (e.g., orchestras swap members)? Heaps or artifacts like airplanes fail if disassembly yields independent objects.

3. **Bounded Function**: Does it have clear topological boundaries and a unified function (e.g., process like digestion)? Systems are often subsystems (dependent on a host). Airplanes lack this; their "function" (flight) is an occurrent process, not inherent.

4. **Causal Unity Type**: Per BFO, check CU1 (physical covering, e.g., organs), CU2 (internal forces, e.g., molecules), CU3 (engineered assembly, e.g., watches). If CU3 applies but without full MSD (e.g., airplane as assembled object), it's an artifact/object, not system.

5. **Host vs. System**: Does it employ subsystems for function (e.g., airplane uses avionics system)? If yes, it's likely a host object/aggregate.

6. **Granularity Check**: At what scale? Subsystems may be systems; wholes like airplanes appear as objects at mesoscopic level.

7. **Failure Mode**: If disrupted, does the whole lose identity or just function? Systems lose unity (e.g., digestive system halts without enzymes); objects persist (airplane sans engines is still an airplane shell).

Run through with examples: A digestive system passes (MSD among organs, bounded function); an airplane fails most (independent parts, host role). This builds rigor transparently.
