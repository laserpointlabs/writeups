### Executive Summary

This paper establishes a foundational ontology for systems engineering (SE), inspired by Barry Smith's Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), to counter dilution from over-theorization. It draws on practical experience in mechanical, electrical, controls, and SE domains, including ontology-driven LLM workflows that slash ICD/CDD modeling time from weeks to minutes. Core entities and relations form a traceable chain, distinguishing artifacts (e.g., aircraft) from true systems (e.g., hydraulics with mutual dependencies). Modular implementation via OWL, Git, and SHACL enables non-breaking evolution. This foundation paves the way for first-order logic (static formalization) and probabilistic extensions (handling uncertainty), prioritizing applied conversion of science to technology in engineering workflows.

### Introduction

Systems engineering frequently grapples with ambiguous definitions, fostering "fruitless churn" in meta-models and theory-first "shields" that evade empirical testing. Over 30 years of hands-on experience—from programming on early computers in 1977 to LLM-accelerated acquisition modeling—reveal that effective SE converts requirements into testable, deployable concepts without rigid lock-in. This ontology, rooted in Smith's BFO, classifies continuants (enduring entities like components) and occurrents (time-bound like processes), sidestepping INCOSE-like vagueness by emphasizing dependence and systemic unity. It critiques over-theorizing, advocating that theory comprise ≤5% of efforts, serving as input for 95% application. For instance, LLM tools extract ontology instances from documents, enabling rapid prototyping of air vehicle models.

### Core Ontological Definitions

The base ontology forms a relational chain, designed for modularity (e.g., OWL files with imports) to support extensions without breakage.

#### Entities
- **Requirement**: A specification continuant, derived from documents like ICDs (e.g., "system must achieve 500km range").
- **Constraint**: A quality entity limiting a Requirement (e.g., "weight < 100kg" or "cost ≤ $1M").
- **Component**: A material continuant (e.g., engine turbine blade).
- **Interface**: A relational boundary, topological in BFO terms (e.g., electrical connector).
- **Process**: An occurrent activity (e.g., fuel combustion generating thrust).
- **Function**: A realizable disposition (e.g., propulsion capability).

#### Relations (Directed, with Dependence)
These relations incorporate BFO-style dependence for traceability:
- Requirement **has_constraint** Constraint
- Requirement **specifies** Component
- Component **presents** Interface
- Component **performs** Process
- Process **realizes** Function
- Function **specifically_depends_upon** Component
- Function **is_triggered_by** Event/Input

#### Conceptual Model Diagram (Text-Based)
```
Requirement --has_constraint--> Constraint
Requirement --specifies--> Component
Component --presents--> Interface
Component --performs--> Process
Process --realizes--> Function
Function --specifically_depends_upon--> Component
Function --is_triggered_by--> Event/Input
```
This chain enables queries like tracing a Requirement to its realized Function, supporting SE traceability in tools like Protégé.

### Distinction of Systems

Drawing from BFO, a system is a non-summative whole characterized by mutual specific dependence (MSD). Mathematical definition:  
\[ S = \sum \{ c_i \} \] where \[ \forall c_j, c_k \in S, \, \text{MSD}(c_j, c_k) \]  
(with MSD defined as \[ \text{SD}(c_j, c_k) \land \text{SD}(c_k, c_j) \], and SD as necessary existence dependence: if \( c_j \) exists, \( c_k \) must exist for it).

Examples:  
- Hydraulic system qualifies (fluid MSD with pipes; removal breaks whole).  
- Aircraft does not (it's a host artifact; subsystems like avionics may qualify).  

Checklist for System Identification:  
| Criterion | Description | Example (Hydraulics) | Example (Aircraft) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Non-Summative | More than part sum | Yes (interdependence) | No (assembly) |
| MSD Present | Mutual dependence | Yes (fluid-pipe) | No (wings detachable) |
| BFO Alignment | Continuants in unity | Yes | No |

### Critiques of Current SE Practices

SE often prioritizes theory over application, diluting impact. Evidence from searches on SE best practices highlights over-reliance on untested models (e.g., INCOSE handbooks emphasize frameworks without validation metrics).

- **Theory as Shield**: Meta-models serve as untested prototypes, shielding teams from documentation or testing amid naive management—echoing experiences where projects stalled in abstraction.
- **Overfocus on Theory**: Engineering is 95% application; exceeding 5% theory breeds dilution (e.g., endless design patterns sans "show me" prototypes). Critique: This biases toward academia, ignoring field realities like constrained budgets.
- **Constraints for Innovation**: Limited catalogs (e.g., approved bolts in aerospace) force simpler designs, fostering elegance. Experience shows constraints reduced risks in controls systems, contrasting unrestricted "blue-sky" approaches that fail in practice.

Balanced evidence: Web searches confirm BFO's application in domains like biology reduces churn, suggesting SE adoption could similarly streamline.

### Modular Design for Non-Breaking Growth

To enable evolution without lock-in:  

- **Modularity**: Use OWL modules (e.g., base.owl importing entities.owl).  
- **Versioning**: Git branches/commits with semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0 for core chain).  
- **Validation**: SHACL shapes (e.g., Component must have minCount 1 Interface).  
- **Syncing**: SPARQL queries for cross-version traceability (e.g., SELECT ?function WHERE { ?req specifies ?comp . ?comp performs ?proc . ?proc realizes ?function }).  

Workflow Example: LLM parses ICD to extract variants (e.g., 3 Components per Requirement); SHACL validates consistency; Git merges ensure no downstream breakage in models like air vehicles. Simulation test: Code execution with NetworkX confirms chain integrity post-extension (graph structure preserved).

### Mathematical Rigor

Employ mereology for aggregates:  
\[ \text{Part}(x,y) \iff P(x,y) \land x \neq y \]  
Traceability modeled as paths in graph \( G = (E, R) \), where E = entities, R = relations. Simulated graph (via Python/NetworkX):  
{'Requirement': {'Constraint': {'label': 'has_constraint'}, 'Component': {'label': 'specifies'}},  
'Constraint': {},  
'Component': {'Interface': {'label': 'presents'}, 'Process': {'label': 'performs'}},  
'Interface': {},  
'Process': {'Function': {'label': 'realizes'}},  
'Function': {'Component': {'label': 'specifically_depends_upon'}, 'Event/Input': {'label': 'is_triggered_by'}},  
'Event/Input': {}}  

This directed graph allows path queries, e.g., from Requirement to Function.

### Applications

- **ICD/CDD Modeling**: Parse documents → instantiate chain → generate conceptual models (e.g., air vehicle hydraulics) in minutes via LLMs, reducing manual effort.  
- **Extension Teaser**: Subsequent papers add System aggregates and Capabilities (dependent on Functions), with first-order logic for static variants and probabilistic methods (e.g., Bayes for uncertainty).  

Table of Workflow Benefits:  
| Step | Traditional Time | Ontology-LLM Time | Benefit |
|------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Extract Entities | Weeks | Minutes | Automation |
| Validate Chain | Days | Seconds (SHACL) | Consistency |
| Merge Variants | Manual churn | Git auto | Non-breaking |

### Conclusion

This ontology restores SE rigor through applied traceability, constrained innovation, and BFO-grounded definitions. It critiques theoretical excesses while enabling modular growth, setting up extensions to first-order and probabilistic formalisms for real-world testing.
