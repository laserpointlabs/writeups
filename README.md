# Systems Engineering & Concept Writeups

Public collection of in‑progress and polished writeups around:

- Concept elaboration tooling (Conceptualizer/)
- Procedural / knowledge operating system ideas (ProcOS/)
- Systems Engineering (SE) foundational ontology research (SE Ontology/)
- Decision framing using the Heilmeier Catechism

## Directory Overview

### Conceptualizer/
Early exploration of a "concept elaboration" workflow: needs, tool specification, and review notes.

### ProcOS/
"Process / Knowledge Operating System" introductory material and a draft specification.

### SE Ontology/
Primary focus area. Includes:
- Base SE Ontology drafts and critiques
- Alignment with Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
- Ontological arguments & rules (e.g., aircraft example)
- Growth/versioning considerations
- White Paper Series (0–4, plus sub‑series 1a, 1b) laying a staged path from intro through probabilistic extensions

### The Heilmeier Catechism.md
Question framework used to structure and evaluate R&D / concept proposals.

## Status & Intent
This repo is intentionally open to: 1) share thinking early, 2) invite critique, 3) enable reuse in other SE ontology discussions. Expect iterative refinement; files may move or be renamed as ontology structure stabilizes.

## Contributing
Issues and PRs welcome (concept gaps, ontological consistency checks, terminology alignment, references). Please keep critiques constructive and reference sources where possible.

## Suggested Future Additions
- LICENSE (MIT or CC-BY-SA depending on reuse intent)
- Citation / DOI (e.g., via Zenodo) once initial baseline stabilizes
- Formal OWL/RDF artifacts for ontology components
- Change log tracking ontological version increments

## License
No explicit license yet. Until one is added, treat content as All Rights Reserved; open a discussion if you need specific reuse rights. (Recommend adding MIT for prose + CC-BY 4.0 or CC-BY-SA 4.0 if broader remix desired.)

## Quick Start
Browse directories; read `SE Ontology White Papers Series` in order for progressive depth. Use the Heilmeier Catechism to frame new concept documents before adding them.
